## How to add a custom item

1. Add a config entry to custom_items.txt. Example:

  ````
  {
  ckey: zuhayr
  character_name: Jane Doe
  item_path: /obj/item/toy/plushie
  item_name: ugly plush toy
  item_icon: flagmask
  item_desc: It's truly hideous.
  req_titles: Assistant, Security Officer
  req_access: 1
  }
  ````

  - ckey should be your key with no spaces or underscores, all in lowercase. 
  - character_name is the exact name you will use for the character the item belongs to.
  - item_name is the object name that will be used when spawned.
  - item_path is the object type the item is based on.
  - item_icon is the icon state the item will use. More details on this below.
  - item_desc is the description the item will use.
  - req_titles is a list of exact titles and alt titles that this item will spawn for. Separate them with a comma and a space (, ) or they will break.
  - req_access is a numerical value corresponding to the various station access constants. I don't recommend using this.

2. Add an icon to represent the item when held in the hand to icons/obj/custom_items.dmi (or whatever your codebase defines as CUSTOM_ITEM_OBJ). The icon state should be the same as the value set for item_icon in the config.

3. Add icons to icons/mob/custom_items.dmi (or, again, whatever your codebase defines as CUSTOM_ITEM_MOB) for inhands. You need a left and right icon. The icon state should be the item_icon followed by _l for left and _r for right.

4. If the item is wearable, add an icon to icons/mob/custom_items.dmi for the on-mob icon.

5. If the item isn't a kit, you're done. Have fun. Kits have several extra variables and icons.

  ````
  {
  ckey: zuhayr
  character_name: Jane Doe
  item_path: /obj/item/device/kit/paint
  item_name: APLU customisation kit
  item_desc: A customisation kit with all the parts needed to turn an APLU into a "Titan's Fist" model.
  kit_name: APLU "Titan's Fist"
  kit_desc: Looks like an overworked, under-maintained Ripley with some horrific damage.
  kit_icon: titan
  additional_data: ripley, firefighter
  }
  ````

  - kit_name is the name that will be used for the items the kit is used on.
  - kit_desc is the description that will be applied to items the kit is used on.
  - kit_icon is the icon_state that the kit will use.
  - additional_data has two roles. For voidsuit kits, it's the type of helmet light overlay to use. For mechs, it's a list of the mech types the kit can be used on (separated by ', ' like titles).

6. For mechs, add three icons to icons/obj/custom_items.dmi - kit_icon, kit_icon-open and kit_icon-broken. These are the mech icon, the icon when stationary and without a pilot, and the wreckage icon respectively. You're done now, good work.

7. For suits, add two icons to icons/obj/custom_items.dmi - kit_icon_suit and kit_icon_helmet. These icons represent the suit parts when in inventory.

8. Add four icons to icons/mob/custom_items.dmi. You need to add in-hand icons (see 3) for both kit_icon_suit and kit_icon_helmet.

9. Add a final two icons to icons/mob/custom_items.dmi under kit_icon_suit and kit_icon_helmet for the on-mob icons.

10. You're done. Compile, test, and discover you misspelled a state, etc.

## How to add a custom AI display

1. Add a config entry to custom_sprites.txt. Either:
  ````
  ckey:ai_name
  ````
  or
  ````
  ckey:ai_name:icon_state
  ````

  - ckey should be your key with no spaces or underscores, all in lowercase. 
  - ai_name is the exact name you will use for the AI the display belongs to.
  - icon_state is the name of your AI icon states without the "-ai" or "-ai-crashed" suffixes. Defaults to the ckey value if unset.
  
  Multiple entries per player is possible, as long as the icon_state value is set and unique, i.e.:
  ````
  ckey:ai_name:custom_icon_1
  ckey:ai_name:custom_icon_2
  ````

2. Add the first or both of the following icon states to icons/custom_synthetic.dmi named {icon_state}-ai and {icon_state}-ai-crash (the ai-crash icon state is optional), replacing {icon_state} with the icon_state value you've selected.
  ````
  ckey_example:ExampleAIName
  ````
  With the example above the resulting icon state names would be "ckey_example-ai" (required) and "ckey_example-ai-crash" (optional).
  
  ````
  ckey_example:ExampleAIName:example_icon_state
  ````
  With the example above the resulting icon state names would be "example_icon_state-ai" (required) and "example_icon_state-ai-crash" (optional).

## How to locally test a custom item

1. Move to your main repo folder and move custom_items.txt from config/example to config/
2. Open custom_items.txt and enter the define information you'll be pushing to the custom-items repo
3. Change ckey in the definition to YOUR CKEY. Change name to a character name you will be using for testing, or just use their name.
4. Add the relevant icons to the relevant files in your main repo folder
5. Compile and run the game. Ready up, taking note of any job or access restrictions, and start the round. If you did it all correctly, you will have spawned the custom item. If not, it should hopefully give you an error message that can point you in the right direction. 
6. Once you're done testing, make sure you revert any changes made in your main repo folder. Do not push custom items related things to the main repo!
