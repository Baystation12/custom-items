// ADDITIONAL INFO FOR TOGGLEABLE JACKETS
custom_icon_state is the icon used when the jacket is closed. It should be the same as item_icon_state.
The open icon in the DMI should be named the same as closed, but with "_open" appended.
Both the on-mob (custom_items_mob.dmi) and obj (custom_items_obj.dmi) must have each of these icons, and they MUST be named the same between files. 
If the icon representing the closed jacket is called "gertrudejacket" in custom_items_mob, it must be named the same in custom_items_obj.
