# Custom items go here. They are modifications of existing paths; look at the example for details.
# Item will spawn if the target has one of the req_titles and if their on-spawn ID has the required access level.
# req_access is going to be a shit to maintain since the config file can't grab constants and has to use integers, use it minimally.
# Separate titles with a single comma and a space (', ') or they'll bork.
